    st.write("""
    People often follow generic diet plans that don't consider individual factors like age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and personal goals.
    As a result, they may not meet their nutritional needs or achieve fitness objectives. There‚Äôs also a lack of personalized insight into how much protein, carbohydrates, fat, and water intake is ideal for them.

    st.markdown("### Project Goal")
    st.write("""
    This project aims to provide a smart, data-driven recommendation system that predicts daily caloric needs and gives a complete macronutrient breakdown.
    It helps users align their food intake with fitness goals such as weight loss, weight gain, or maintenance.

    st.markdown("### Objectives")
    st.markdown("""
    - Predict daily calorie needs based on personal inputs (age, gender, weight, height, activity level, sleep hours).
    - Recommend personalized protein, carbs, fat, and water intake.
    - Suggest caloric deficit/surplus based on the selected fitness goal.
    - Display predicted BMI and compare it to ideal ranges.
